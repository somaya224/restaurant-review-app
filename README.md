# Restaurant Reviews App

## Overview

This is the fifth  project for my Udacity frontend Nanodegree Program.
Udacity provided us with a static webpage For Restaurant Reviews which lacks accessibility and not rsponsive
I had three tasks to do
*  Convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays
* Convert the design to be accessible for screen reader use
*  Add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users

## The Project Purpose
Learning how to fix pre-existing application code to meet the spesification required.

## How to Run the Application?
1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the project
2. start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer
    * In a terminal check if you already have Node.js and npm installed by typing: `node -v` and  `npm -v` , or you can install NodeJS and npm by going to [Node's official site](https://nodejs.org/en/) and downloading the latest version of NodeJS.
    * After Node.js and npm hane been installed, run this command  `npm install http-server -g` , This will install http-server globally so that it may be run from the command line.
    * In terminal navigate to your resturant app folder then type this command `http-sever` this will your local server at port 8080 (or some other port, if port 8080 is already in use.)
    * With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8080` and start your experince with resturant reviews
